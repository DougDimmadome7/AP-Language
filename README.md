# AP-Language
This is a work in progress implementation of the pseudocode language used in College Board's AP Computer Science Principles exam. 

## Functionality
  Currently, the code allows a user to write code conforming to the AP Pseudocode syntax and have the code interpreted as normal
code. You can create variables, for and while loops, procedures (recursive procedures, procedures with arguments, etc), and much more.
This code isn't intended for any practical purposes, more as simply an exercise in creating a custom language on top of Python.

## Planned Functionality
  - Adding syntax highlighting for VS Code and other text editors.
  - Adding list and string support
  - Syntax errors and proper error messages (not simply using Python's error messages)
